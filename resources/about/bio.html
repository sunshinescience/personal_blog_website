                        <p>Hi, I'm Sunshine. Yes, its my real name. And yes, my parents were hippies. I'm a California girl born and bred. But I'm currently in the United Kingdom (near Oxford).
                        <br><br>I'm a scientist turned front end developer. I completed my BS in geology and MS in geochemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles. Afterwards, I upgraded and expanded a 
                        supercomputer for an instrument aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. It was amazing to piece together hardware, but I  
                        was intrigued by the software side of things...<br><br>I've travelled a lot in the states (I've been to 48 out of 50 states). The first time I went to the other side of the world was when I moved there - to get my PhD in Sedimentology at Imperial College, London. During that time, I gained some exposure to Python, which really piqued my interest in coding. <br><br>I’m currently in a Udacity nanodegree program for front end web development.
                        <br><br>Thanks for stopping by.
                        </p>
