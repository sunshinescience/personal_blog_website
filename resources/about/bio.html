                    <p>My name is Sunshine Abbott. I'm an American and a front end developer.<br><br/>During my BS degree, I majored in geology, then geochemistry (MS degree), and lastly 
                        sedimentology (PhD). In between my MS and PhD degrees I was fortunate to have gotten a job 
                        as a hardware specialist for the Principal Investigator of the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, 
                        an instrument aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. I had the privilege of working 
                        on a great team with an awesome supervisor. I upgraded and expanded their 
                        supercomputer. It was amazing to learn about the hardware. But I must admit, the 
                        software side of things really intrigued me...<br><br/>I moved across the world to get my PhD in Sedimentology at Imperial College, London. During my 
                        PhD, I gained exposure to some coding (Python). The project piqued my interest in coding 
                        and led me to transition into the tech sector. <br><br/>I’m currently in a Udacity nanodegree program for front end web development.
