TODO:
- deploy travel app to heroku
- All pages (except about page): 
    make respponsive
    Fix bottom part, use arrows and text to scroll through pages in blogs and portfolio and have black background
- Post pages: get text to not move with resize
        Change previous post and next post to their title with an arrow, in a black background
        Fix all post pages to have same styles as post-3
- Portfolio page: Make responsive with various media sizes (things don't move properly when shrinking to smaller size)
    see https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp
    Fix all portfolio pages to have same styles as project-4
- Footer: add Python blog?
- Post page number 3: make list have bullets
- In my posts page, use a photo gallery, and on hover, make transparency less using opaque, and bring the title of the article down
- (jQuery ?) function to write HTML style code on a page, could be useful for blogs
- Note: Internet Explorer 10 and earlier versions do not support the flex-wrap property. Fix photo gallery accordingly on those sites (?)
- TODO: find why there is a gap below images in blog 3 and bio photo gallery
- make all pages responsive, use media queries, see: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp
- CSS and Flex blog, make images shrink when changing width smaller
